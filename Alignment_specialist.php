            <h1>Endodontics</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Align Dental Specialties is an Endodontics practice in San Antonio, TX with healthcare providers who have special training and skill in preventing, diagnosing, and treating conditions of the dental pulp (the soft tissue inside teeth). Endodontists at Align Dental Specialties perform maintenance and treatment of dental pulp diseases or injuries. Endodontics is a dental specialty that maintains dental pulp health. Significant diseases and conditions treated at Endodontics practices include cavities, tooth cracks, dental abscesses, dental pulp stones, exposed dental pulp, and pulp necrosis. Medical tests, procedures and therapies provided by Endodontics practices include consultations, root canals, dental implants, and endodontic surgery.</p>

            Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances
            of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth.
            <p>The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture
                during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic
                since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of
                adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites
                for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic
                procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.</p>
