        <h1 class="img">Cavity inspection</h1>
        <div class="box1">

            <p>
            A body cavity search, also known simply as a cavity search, is either a visual search or a manual internal inspection of body cavities for
             prohibited materials (contraband), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons. Body cavities frequently used for concealment include
             the mouth, vagina, and rectum. It is far more invasive than the standard strip search that is typically performed on individuals taken into 
             custody, either upon police arrest or incarceration at a jail, prison, or psychiatric hospital. Often the procedure is repeated when the person 
             leaves the institution.
             Body cavity searches may also be conducted at some international border crossings such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when they
             suspect international travelers of hiding contraband—such as drugs.
            </p>

                <p>
                Many articles of contraband are concealable in the body's cavities, via means such as insertion into the rectum. Illegal drugs are often
                 found in condoms and temporarily stowed in the colon, and cylinders such as Cigar Tubes are used to hide money, intravenous syringes,
                  and knives. Duplicate handcuff keys could be concealed in many body orifices, such as in the nasal passages or underneath the tongue.
                </p>

                <p>
                During manual body cavity searches, an inmate is temporarily transferred to an offsite clinic to be examined by a licensed physician of 
                the same sex; body orifices are probed using fingers or instruments. The circumstances in which these inspections may be done are often
                 restricted, such as on individuals refusing to offer to consent to a visual body cavity search for reasons other than anxiety or in 
                 situations where there is a strong evidence to suspect the presence of contraband, and require a court order.
