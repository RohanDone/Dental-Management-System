            <h3>True Healthcare For Your Family</h3>
            <p>Family health insurance plans as the name suggests are health plans that are specially designed for families. 
               These medical insurance plans cover your immediate family members like spouse, children, parents and grandparents under a single plan.
               Under family health insurance plans, you can cover a legally wedded spouse, dependent children, parents, parents-in-law, etc., apart from self, on a floater sum insured basis.
               Simply put, with a family floater health insurance policy, one can claim up to a full sum insured amount, in case of an emergency. However, this would reduce the coverage benefits for other family members. 
               The most important feature of family floater health insurance is that most plans cover COVID-19 treatment, which means that you can now benefit from long-term coverage from a new or existing medical coverage strategy if COVID-19 results are positive.</p>
