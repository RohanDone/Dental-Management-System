            <h1>Oral Hygiene Tips</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Ensuring healthy teeth through good oral hygiene yields overall health benefits. Dental problems such as tooth decay and gum disease not only lead to tooth loss, but are associated with serious, chronic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and diabetes.
                Along with proper toothbrushing twice a day and daily flossing, maintaining a healthy smile can also mean making dietary adjustments, limiting alcohol and tobacco use, and ensuring you’re keeping up with regular dental appointments.
                Here’s a quick overview of what you should keep in mind to protect your teeth. </p>

            <h1>What Is Good Oral Hygiene?</h1>
            <p>Good oral hygiene, simply put, is a set of practices and habits that promote and protect your teeth and gums. But how can we tell our care is healthy? What defines good oral health? Current consensus is that good oral hygiene is the ability to speak, chew, and make facial expressions without pain, discomfort, or loss of confidence. It’s, therefore, an essential aspect of mental and physical health.
                Fundamentally, the aim of a good oral hygiene routine is to prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar on the teeth. Related and equally important, it’s working to stop the progression of or deter gum disease and gingivitis (or periodontitis, a severe form that arises in the absence of treatment).</p>

            <h1>How to Practice Good Oral Hygiene</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Ultimately, good oral hygiene is more of a journey than a destination. Not only does it require adopting and adhering to positive habits, it means being ready to learn ways to get even better at caring for your teeth and gums. Here are some key points to keep in mind.</p>

            <h1>Brush Thoroughly Twice a Day</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>It’s common knowledge that regular and thorough toothbrushing twice a day is a cornerstone of dental hygiene. Every morning and every night, spend about two minutes brushing your teeth, with 30 seconds for each side (lower front, lower back, upper front, and upper back).
            Keep in mind that you should replace toothbrushes regularly (every three to four months or if the head is worn out and loose).</p>

            <h1>Use Dental Products That Contain Fluoride</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The mineral fluoride can also help strengthen teeth. Choose toothpaste that contains fluoride, such as those approved by the American Dental Association (ADA).</p>

            <h1>Don’t Neglect Flossing</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Along with brushing, flossing between the teeth daily is critical to protecting dental health. In addition to standard floss, other means can make this even easier, including using pre-threaded flossers or water flossing devices.
            By removing food trapped between the teeth and along the gumline, flossing gets at food particles that brushing isn’t able to access.</p>

            <h1>Practice Brushing Techniques</h1>
            <hr>
            <ol>1.The right size: Make sure the toothbrush you use is appropriately sized, allowing you to access every dental surface in your mouth.</ol>
            <ol>2.Appropriate angle: Generally, keep your brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums.</ol>
            <ol>3.Get all the sides: Make sure you are brushing the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of your teeth.</ol>
            <ol>4.Short strokes: Employ gentle, brief strokes, moving back and forth as you brush. Brush inner surfaces of front teeth with vertical (up and down) strokes.</ol>
            <ol>5.Tongue care: Since the tongue can also be a repository for plaque-causing bacteria, make sure you brush it as well.</ol>

            <h1>Avoiding Dry Mouth</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>An unintended side effect of some medications is dry mouth, which can impact dental health. Talk to your dentist about your options if you know or suspect the drugs you’re taking are leading to this condition.</p>

            <h1>Limit Alcohol and Tobacco Products</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Among the many negative health effects of drinking alcohol are significant impacts on dental health. Alcohol is a noted risk factor for oral cancer, and consumption has been associated with developing periodontitis.
            In addition, smoking or using smokeless tobacco is closely associated with gum disease. These habits weaken the immune system, making it easier for gingivitis and periodontitis to develop.</p>
        
            <h1>Use Mouthwash</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Another strategy that can help maintain good dental hygiene is to use mouthwash. Not all products are the same, and some—cosmetic mouthwashes—don’t really go after the bacteria that cause gingivitis and bad breath.
            Generally, you’re best served using therapeutic mouthwashes. Look for the following active ingredients in over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription mouthwash:</p>
            <ol>1.Cetylpyridinium chloride</ol>
            <ol>2.Chlorhexidine</ol>
            <ol>3.Essential oils</ol>
            <ol>4.Fluoride</ol>
            <ol>5.Peroxide</ol>
